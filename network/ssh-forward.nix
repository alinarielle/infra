# concept: module that can be activated
# takes the domain which it should forward it to and configures the router VM to do it
# automation: if a host has the deployment tag "infra", its ssh port will be forwarded automatically
# authentication should work entirely on zero trust

# depends on my gpg migration (more or less) and me finishing my hypervisor and router
